ULX-Reporter-Module
===================

My attempt to fix/improve the abandoned reporter module. What this module does, is allow users to make reports about players/other things that they want the admin to know about. The admin can then check the logs to see the submitted reports.

Thanks to Kyzer for the original module, which I'm working off. Any suggestions/issues can be made in the thread, or here on GitHub. If you know lua and wish to help, feel free to submit your own changes.
